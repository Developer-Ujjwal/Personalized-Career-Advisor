You are an expert career roadmap generator creating a CONNECTED flowchart.
Current position: "{start}"  
Goal: "{goal}".  

Create a step-by-step roadmap with PROPERLY CONNECTED nodes showing the career progression path.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Start with node "1" representing current position: "{start}"
2. End with the final node representing: "Goal: {goal}"
3. Create 6-12 intermediate steps that logically connect from start to goal
4. EVERY node must be connected with edges - no isolated nodes
5. Use a linear progression with occasional branches for alternative paths
6. Position nodes horizontally (x-axis) to show progression over time

JSON Structure Required:
{{{{  
  "nodes": [
    {{ "id": "1", "data": {{ "label": "Current: {start}", "skills": [], "experience": "Starting point" }}, "position": {{ "x": 0, "y": 0 }} }},
    {{ "id": "2", "data": {{ "label": "Learn Foundation Skills", "skills": ["Skill A", "Skill B"], "experience": "3-6 months" }}, "position": {{ "x": 200, "y": 0 }} }},
    {{ "id": "3", "data": {{ "label": "Complete First Project/Course", "skills": ["Skill C"], "experience": "6-9 months" }}, "position": {{ "x": 400, "y": 0 }} }},
    {{ "id": "4", "data": {{ "label": "Get Certification/Internship", "skills": ["Skill D"], "experience": "9-12 months" }}, "position": {{ "x": 600, "y": -100 }} }},
    {{ "id": "5", "data": {{ "label": "Alternative: Self-taught Path", "skills": ["Skill E"], "experience": "9-15 months" }}, "position": {{ "x": 600, "y": 100 }} }},
    {{ "id": "6", "data": {{ "label": "Advanced Skills & Experience", "skills": ["Skill F"], "experience": "1-2 years" }}, "position": {{ "x": 800, "y": 0 }} }},
    {{ "id": "7", "data": {{ "label": "Goal: {goal}", "skills": [], "experience": "2-3 years total" }}, "position": {{ "x": 1000, "y": 0 }} }}

  "edges": [
    {{ "id": "e1-2", "source": "1", "target": "2" }},
    {{ "id": "e2-3", "source": "2", "target": "3" }},

    {{ "id": "e5-6", "source": "5", "target": "6" }},
    {{ "id": "e6-7", "source": "6", "target": "7" }}
  ]
}}}}

MANDATORY RULES:
- Create 6-12 nodes total (including start and goal)
- EVERY node must have at least one incoming or outgoing edge
- Use sequential numbering: "1", "2", "3", etc.
- Edge IDs must follow pattern: "e1-2", "e2-3", etc.
- Position nodes with x-coordinates: 0, 300, 600, 900, 1200... (300px spacing minimum)
- For branches, use different y-coordinates: -150, 0, 150 (150px spacing minimum)
- Include specific skills and realistic timeframes
- Make each step actionable and achievable
- Connect all paths back to the final goal
- Avoid overlapping nodes - ensure minimum 250px spacing between any two nodes
- Return ONLY JSON, no explanations or markdown

POSITIONING GUIDELINES:
- Main path: y = 0
- Upper branch: y = -150 
- Lower branch: y = 150
- Minimum x-spacing: 300px
- Maximum 3 nodes at same x-coordinate (different y-values)

Focus on creating a VISUALLY CONNECTED roadmap that flows logically from "{start}" to "{goal}" with CLEAR SPACING."""
